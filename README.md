SECURE ONLINE VOTING

Using the technology that’s advancing everyday, our voting system can be made online. It makes the
voting system more secure and accurate and easier to maintain. One such technology that could bring
about this change could be with the 'Blockchain'.
First the validation of a person happens via fingerprint verification and then once the person is logged in
he/she has to either pass the stress detection test(one way to identify that he/she isn’t forced by
anyone) or the 360 degree camera test(nobody is around the voter when he/she cast the vote).Based
the location ,the voter gets a list of candidates and the vote is recorded. The voter can opt to cast their
vote void within two days of vote which could send a signal to the nearest police station on request and
then is void after certain verification.All of this is implemented using the Blockchain Technology.
